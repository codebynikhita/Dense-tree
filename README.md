# Dense Graph in C

This project implements a dense graph using adjacency lists in C.  
It allows users to input the number of vertices and edges, add edges, and then print the graph structure.

## 🔧 Features

- Create and initialize a graph
- Add directed edges between vertices
- Display the graph using an adjacency list

## 📁 Files

- `Dense graph.c` – Main program file containing the implementation

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 1. Compile the code

```bash
gcc "Dense graph.c" -o densegraph
